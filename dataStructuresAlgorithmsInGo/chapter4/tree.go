// “Tree is a hierarchical data structure. The top element of a tree is called the root of the tree. Except the root element, every element in a tree has a parent element, and zero or more child elements. The tree is the most useful data structure when you have hierarchical information to store.”

// “A binary tree is a type of tree in which each node has at most two children (0, 1 or 2) which are referred as left child and right child.”

// “A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree on which nodes are ordered in the following way:
// 1.    The key in the left subtree is less than the key in its parent node.
// 2.    The key in the right subtree is greater or equal the key in its parent node.”

// “There are two types of skewed tree.
// 1.    Right Skewed binary tree: A binary tree in which each node is having either a right child or no child.
// 2.    Left Skewed binary tree: A binary tree in which each node is having either a left child or no child.”

// “There are few binary search tree, which keeps themselves balanced. Most important among them are Red-Black Tree and AVL tree. Ordered dictionary in collections is implemented using Red Black-Tree.”
