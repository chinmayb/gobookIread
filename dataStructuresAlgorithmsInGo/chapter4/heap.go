// “Priority queue is implemented using a binary heap data structure. In a heap, the records are stored in an array. Each node in the heap follows the same rule that the parent value is greater than its children are.
//
// There are two types of the heap data structure:
// 1.    Max heap: each node should be greater than or equal to each of its children.
// 2.    Min heap: each node should be smaller than or equal to each of its children.
