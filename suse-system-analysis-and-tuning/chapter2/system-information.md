1. Device Load Information: iostat
To monitor the system device load, use iostat. It generates reports that
can be useful for better balancing the load between physical disks
attached to your system.
To be able to use iostat, install the package sysstat.
The first iostat report shows statistics collected since the system was
booted. Subsequent reports cover the time sine the previous report.

[root@nginx ~]# iostat
Linux 2.6.32-504.16.2.el6.x86_64 (nginx)        2017年03月16日  _x86_64_    (1 CPU)

avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
           0.74    0.00    0.37    0.05    0.00   98.84

Device:            tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
sda               4.97         0.40        33.46    2955100  250224528
sdb               0.00         0.00         0.28       2944    2097144

invoking iostat in this way will help you find out whether throughput is 
different from your expectation, but not why. Such questions can be better
answered by an extended report which can be generated by invoking iostat -x.
Extended reports additionally include, for example, information on average queue
sizes and average wait times. It may also be easier to evalute the data if idle
block devices are excluded using the -z switch. Find definitions for each of 
the displayed column titles in the man page of iostat (man 1 iostat).

2. Processor Activity Monitoring: mpstat
The utility mpstat examines activities of each available processor. If your 
system has one process only, the global average statistics will be reported.

3. Processor Frequency Monitoring: turbostat
turbostat shows frequencies, load, temperature, and power of AMD64/Intel 64
processors. It can operate in two modes: If called with a command, the command
process if forked and statistics are displayed upon command completion. When run
without a command, it will display updated statistics every five seconds.
NOTE: turbostat requires the Kernel module msr to be loaded.

4. Task Monitoring: pidstat
If you need to see what load a particular task applies to your system, use 
pidstat command. It prints activity of every selected task or all tasks managed
by Linux kernel if no task is specified. You can also set the number of reports
to be displayed and the time interval between them.
For example, pidstat -C firefox 2 3 prints the load statistics for tasks whose
command name includes the string "firefox". There will be three reports printed
at two second intervals.
Similarly, using pidstat -d can be used to estimate how much I/O tasks are doing
, whether they are sleeping on that IO and how long many clock ticks the task
was stalled.

5. Kernel Ring Buffer: dmesg
The Linux kernel keeps certain messages in a ring buffer. To view these message,
enter the command dmesg -T. Older events are logged in the systemd journal.

6. List of Open Files: lsof 
To view a list of all the files open for the process with process ID PID, use -p.
For example, to view all the files used by the current shell, enter:

[root@nginx ~]# lsof -p $$
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF    NODE NAME
bash    11547 root  cwd    DIR    8,1     4096 1179649 /root
bash    11547 root  rtd    DIR    8,1     4096       2 /
bash    11547 root  txt    REG    8,1   904872  262151 /bin/bash
bash    11547 root  mem    REG    8,1    65928  786478 /lib64/libnss_files-2.12.so
bash    11547 root  mem    REG    8,1 99158576 1050588 /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
bash    11547 root  mem    REG    8,1  1921176  786444 /lib64/libc-2.12.so
bash    11547 root  mem    REG    8,1    19536  786460 /lib64/libdl-2.12.so
bash    11547 root  mem    REG    8,1   132408  786488 /lib64/libtinfo.so.5.7
bash    11547 root  mem    REG    8,1   154624  786435 /lib64/ld-2.12.so
bash    11547 root  mem    REG    8,1    26060 1050495 /usr/lib64/gconv/gconv-modules.cache
bash    11547 root    0u   CHR  136,4      0t0       7 /dev/pts/4
bash    11547 root    1u   CHR  136,4      0t0       7 /dev/pts/4
bash    11547 root    2u   CHR  136,4      0t0       7 /dev/pts/4
bash    11547 root  255u   CHR  136,4      0t0       7 /dev/pts/4

The special shell variable $$, whose value is the process ID of the shell, has been used.
When used with -i, lsof lists currently open Internet files as well.

7. Kernel and udev Event Sequence Viewer: udevadm monitor

[root@nginx ~]# udevadm monitor
monitor will print the received events for:
UDEV - the event which udev sends out after rule processing
KERNEL - the kernel uevent

NOTE: only root user is allow to monitor udev events by running the udevadm command.
udevadm monitor listens to the kernel uevents and events sent out by a udev rule and
prints the device path (DEVPATH) of the event to the console.
