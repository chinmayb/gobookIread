1. Time Measurement with time
Determine the time spend by commands with the time utility. This utility
is available in two versions: as a Bash built-in and as a program.
(/usr/bin/time).
The output of /usr/bin/time is much more detailed. It is recommended to
run it with the -v switch to produce human-readable output.
